### Task
  This code creates a node.js application that will mimic a blockchain application. 
### The submission examines:
- API development with Node.js
- proof-of-work-based systems
- create BackEnd Node.JS servers, with an express API and TDD  
###  Requirement
- The application must be built as a REST API with endpoints to be able to create blocks in a blockchain.
- to list all blocks in a blockchain as well
- retrieve any block from the blockchain.
- The application must be structured around the MVC design pattern.
- Error handling according to "best practice" must be used (what we have gone through)
- The blockchain must be written to a json file so that it exists even after restarting the server.
- Logging of errors must be written to a physical error log
- ES6 modules should be used instead of CommonJS modules.
- The creation of blocks must be test driven (TDD)
- Each block must be verified and validated ("Proof Of Work")
